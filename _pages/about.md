PhD student in __Mathematics__ under the supervision of [Todor Tsankov](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~tsankov/) ([ICJ](https://www.math.univ-lyon1.fr/), Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1) and [Christian Rosendal](https://sites.google.com/view/christian-rosendal) ([University of Maryland at College Park](https://www-math.umd.edu/)).

## Field of Research

My interests lie at the intersection of topological group theory, geometry and model theory. At the moment, I am looking at the representation theory of permutation groups (e.g. Aut \\( ( \mathbb{Q} ,<) \\) or acting on regular trees).
