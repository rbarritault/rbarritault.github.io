Here is a list of talks I have given to seminars or work-groups:

* **Le théorème de Glimm**, a two-session lecture in collaboration with Basile Morando for the work-group "Groupes de Type I" at the ENS de Lyon.
* **Tannaka-Krein duality for Roelcke-precompact non-Archimedean polish groups**, a presentation of the work contained in my first pre-print, given both to the Logic seminar at [ICJ](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr) 
and to the Operator algebra seminar at [IMJ-PRG](https://www.imj-prg.fr/).
